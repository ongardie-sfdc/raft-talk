# Raft talk slides

Slides on Raft that I use for my usual talks.

See the slides at <https://ongardie.github.io/raft-talk/>, or
watch recordings at <https://raft.github.io/#talks>.

To use this on your local computer, be sure to download the git submodules
first:

    git submodule update --init --recursive
